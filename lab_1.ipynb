        "\n",
        "In 2016, [ProPublica published an analysis](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) of the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) tool. COMPAS is a proprietary tool which generates a so-called risk assessment for defendants in a criminal trial. ProPublica's analysis focused on the \"recidivism score,\" which purports to provide the likelihood of recidivism (i.e. committing a misdemeanor of felony) within two years of assessment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will go through parts of ProPublica's analysis of COMPAS, focusing on how the recidivism risk scale varies by race and sex.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook has four stages in which we will:\n",
        "1. Import the data, implement a few pre-processing steps, and inspect the data\n",
        "2. Run a short exploratory analysis of the COMPAS recidivism score, our primary variable of interest\n",
        "3. Reproduce the logistic regression model in ProPublica's analysis and interpret the estimates\n",
        "4. Compute the predictive accuracy of the risk score labels"

        "Refer to the description of the [data collection methodology](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm). Salient points are highlighted below; see the full description from ProPublica for additional details.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Goal:** We looked at more than 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida, and compared their predicted recidivism rates with the rate that actually occurred over a two-year period.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **COMPAS tool input (data subjects):** When most defendants are booked in jail, they respond to a COMPAS questionnaire. Their answers are fed into the COMPAS software to generate several scores including predictions of Risk of Recidivism and Risk of Violent Recidivism.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **How COMPAS input was acquired by ProPublica:** Through a public records request, ProPublica obtained two years worth of COMPAS scores from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida. We received data for all 18,610 people who were scored in 2013 and 2014.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **COMPAS tool output:** Each pretrial defendant received at least three COMPAS scores: \"Risk of Recidivism,\" \"Risk of Violence\" and \"Risk of Failure to Appear. [...] COMPAS scores for each defendant ranged from 1 to 10, with ten being the highest risk. Scores 1 to 4 were labeled by COMPAS as \"Low;\" 5 to 7 were labeled “Medium;\" and 8 to 10 were labeled “High.”\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Data integration (record linkage):** Starting with the database of COMPAS scores, we built a profile of each person’s criminal history, both before and after they were scored. We collected public criminal records from the Broward County Clerk’s Office website through April 1, 2016. On average, defendants in our dataset were not incarcerated for 622.87 days (sd: 329.19). We matched the criminal records to the COMPAS records using a person’s first and last names and date of birth. This is the same technique used in the Broward County COMPAS validation study conducted by researchers at Florida State University in 2010. We downloaded around 80,000 criminal records from the Broward County Clerk’s Office website.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **What is recidivism?** Northpointe defined recidivism as “a finger-printable arrest involving a charge and a filing for any uniform crime reporting (UCR) code.” We interpreted that to mean a criminal offense that resulted in a jail booking and took place after the crime for which the person was COMPAS scored. [...] For most of our analysis, we defined recidivism as a new arrest within two years."
